    <h2> This is my About Me section</h2>

    <hr>
    <p> I go to Huguenot High School. I also attend J Sarge Community College in the mornings. I have a crochet business
        where I make trendy crochet clothing for teens;)
        I live with my mom in SOuthside Richmond. I have a brother that is ten years older than me.
        I am very independent and eager to work.

        I have only had work experience through my crochet business. This may seem like a small thing, but it is
        actually extremely hard running a full time business as a full time student. I also had a paid intership via
        Girls For a Change. I worked as a social media marketer with Emergent Social Solutions. I took pictures and
        planned social media post to engage with potential clients.

        My school performance is excellent. I currently hold a 4.67 GPA at Huguenot High School. I take 14 classes a
        year. This is due to my hefty schedule as a dual enrollment student. Dual enrollment basically is to take
        several college classes on campus in order to receive an Associates degree in Social Sciences.
        I am also president of the Student Councial Association at my school. I am the junior representative for class
        of 2023, in which I graduate. Girls For a Change is a program I am apart of as a Girl Ambassador and Girl Action
        Team member. It is a nonprofit based in Richmond, Virginia for Black girls in the inner city and surrounding
        counties.

        I want to go to college to study Forensic Psychology. I have my top 16 schools already sorted out. I would
        prefer to go to an HBCU. I really eitehr want to be a forensic psychologist or a lawyer. No particular form of
        lawyer has gaged me the hardest. Possibly a divorce lawyer is in my future.
        After college, I want to get a internship at my dream Black owned law office. hopefully, in the future, I can
        get my own practice> i dream to be my own boss. I pray that tha is in my future. </p>

        <hr>

        <p>I hold a job. It is not technically a real job. I work for myself. I own my own business making crochet
            clothing
            throughout my area and many other statess. I have shipped to 13 out of 50 states and Canada. I am really
            proud of
            myself and believe this sums up my leadership and independence. </p>
